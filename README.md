Final Project
=====================
This project was developed as a final work for “Internet Programming Languages” (Языки интернет-программирования) course. 

My project aims to connect fans all over the world in order to help each other with collecting their favourite artist’s photocards. By the means of this web application everybody will be able to create and edit their posts using a convenient template and also look at other fan’s posts to find the ultimate deal for the photocard they’re missing in their collection.
